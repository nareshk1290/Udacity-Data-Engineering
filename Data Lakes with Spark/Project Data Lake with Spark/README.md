<b>Project: Data Lake</b>

<b>Introduction</b>

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database even more and want to move their data warehouse to a data lake. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app


<b>Project Description</b>

Apply the knowledge of Spark and Data Lakes to build and ETL pipeline for a Data Lake hosted on Amazon S3

In this task, we have to build an ETL Pipeline that extracts their data from S3 and process them using Spark and then load back into S3 in a set of Fact and Dimension Tables. This will allow their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening. Will have to deploy this Spark process on a Cluster using AWS

<b>Project Datasets</b>

Song Data Path --> s3://udacity-dend/song_data Log Data Path --> s3://udacity-dend/log_data Log Data JSON Path --> s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json

<b>Song Dataset</b>

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset(https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example:

song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}

<b>Log Dataset</b>

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format. The log files in the dataset with are partitioned by year and month. For example:

log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json

And below is an example of what a single log file, 2018-11-13-events.json, looks like.

{"artist":"Pavement", "auth":"Logged In", "firstName":"Sylvie", "gender", "F", "itemInSession":0, "lastName":"Cruz", "length":99.16036, "level":"free", "location":"Klamath Falls, OR", "method":"PUT", "page":"NextSong", "registration":"1.541078e+12", "sessionId":345, "song":"Mercy:The Laundromat", "status":200, "ts":1541990258796, "userAgent":"Mozilla/5.0(Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_4...)", "userId":10}

<b>Schema for Song Play Analysis</b>

A Star Schema would be required for optimized queries on song play queries

<b>Fact Table</b>

<b>songplays</b> - records in event data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

<b>Dimension Tables</b>

<b>users</b> - users in the app user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level

<b>songs</b> - songs in music database song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration

<b>artists</b> - artists in music database artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude

<b>time</b> - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

<b>Project Template</b>

Project Template include three files:

<b>1. etl.py</b> reads data from S3, processes that data using Spark and writes them back to S3

<b>2. dl.cfg</b> contains AWS Credentials

<b>3. README.md</b> provides discussion on your process and decisions

<b>ETL Pipeline</b>

1. Load the credentials from dl.cfg
2. Load the Data which are in JSON Files(Song Data and Log Data)
3. After loading the JSON Files from S3
4.Use Spark process this JSON files and then generate a set of Fact and Dimension Tables
5. Load back these dimensional process to S3

<b>Final Instructions</b>

1. Write correct keys in dl.cfg
2. Open Terminal write the command "python etl.py"
3. Should take about 2-4 mins in total
